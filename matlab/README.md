- [create_orthophoto.m](create_orthophoto.m/): A MATLAB script programmed as part of a university assignment in 2023. It generates an orthophoto by projecting LiDAR data onto aerial imagery using camera orientation parameters. It includes 3D-to-2D projection, height interpolation, and grayscale image resampling. While the overall framework was provided, all sections marked with % Implemented by me indicate functionality I personally wrote, including the core computational methods for interpolation, projection, and image transformation (incl. the following functions: inverse_distance_weighting_interpolation, collinearity_equation, camera_coordinates2image_coordinates and bilinear_interpolation). Data that was used for this exercise found in the folder [data](data/).
