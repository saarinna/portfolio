- [munincipal_exercise.R](munincipal_exercise.R/): An R-script programmed as part of a university assignment in 2023. It performs spatial analysis on a set of Finnish municipalities. It loads and visualizes municipal boundaries, selects specific municipalities for focused analysis, and assigns color codes for visualization. The script constructs spatial neighbor relationships based on polygon contiguity, computes an adjacency matrix, and assigns crime rates to the selected municipalities. It then calculates Moranâ€™s I statistic to assess spatial autocorrelation of crime rates. Finally, the script computes and plots both the geographic mean center and a crime-rate weighted mean center of the selected municipalities.. Data that was used for this exercise found in the folder [Munincipals_Finland](Munincipals_Finland/).
